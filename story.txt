The Lantern on the Hill

On the outskirts of a quiet village, there was a lone hill crowned by an old stone lantern.
Every evening, no matter the weather, that lantern would flicker to life with a warm golden glow—though no one had tended it for years.

The villagers whispered that a spirit lived inside, guarding them from misfortune. Children dared each other to climb the hill, but none made it beyond halfway before fear or shadows turned them back.

One night, Mira, a curious 17‑year‑old with a stubborn streak, decided to see for herself. Armed with nothing but a lantern of her own and her grandfather’s old cloak, she climbed under a sky scattered with stars. Wind tugged at her hair. The grass whispered against her boots.

Halfway up, the glow from the stone lantern grew brighter, pulsing like a heartbeat.
When she reached it, she saw not just a lantern, but a figure—a woman in flowing robes, translucent as moonlight, holding the flame between her hands.

“You shouldn’t be here,” the spirit murmured, her voice soft and sad.
“But… you’ve been watching over us, haven’t you?” Mira asked.

The spirit’s gaze drifted over the village below. “I lit this lantern the day my child left for war. I told him I would keep it burning until he returned. He never did.”

Mira felt a pang in her chest. “You don’t have to wait alone anymore.”

The spirit’s eyes shimmered. She placed the golden flame into Mira’s lantern. “Then carry it for me. Let it guide you, and you will guide them.”

When Mira descended the hill, the stone lantern was dark for the first time in centuries.
But as she stepped into the village, her lantern shone brighter than the stars—
and from that night on, no traveler was ever lost again.
